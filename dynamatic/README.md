# [WIP] Dynamatic

This image is created for the [dynamatic][dynamatic-github] tool which compiles `c`/`cpp` code into `vhdl` using 'elastic' components.

The image was tested only for the elastic pass (compiling and running it), and buffers(compiling), so it's still a `WIP`. Also, the image uses an older version of the dynamatic code, as it looks like the recent changes contain a break.
